# Staking

Thanks to [Proposal #10](https://tornadocash.eth.link/governance/10), any [$TORN](torn.md) holder can lock their [$TORN](torn.md) token into Governance contract like before, but are now able to receive a portion of the fees collected by relayers proportionately to their stake.

As explained [here](https://torn.community/t/proposal-relayer-registry-setting-parameters-after-audit/2134), on every withdrawal via relayer, the relayer has to pay a fee from his staked balance. Currently, this fee is fixed at 0.3% and can be changed at any time by a governance vote.

### How to lock $TORN token ?

In order to lock $TORN token,

Go to: [https://tornadocash.eth.link/governance](https://tornadocash.eth.link/governance)

Click `Manage` -> `Lock Tab`

Approve the governance contract to transfer your TORN tokens by clicking on the `Approve` button. Once the approve is confirmed, chose the amount you want to deposit and click `Lock`. Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait for the confirmation.
