# Staking

Since its inception, the TORN token is used by Tornado Cash users for governance. Its main utility is to allow the suggestion of proposals & voting both in-chain (through locked TORN for governance proposals) and off-chain (on Snapshot).

Since the execution of [Tornado Cash 10th governance proposal](https://tornadocash.eth.limo/governance/10), TORN token has gained one other useful utility. Indeed, **with the introduction of a decentralized relayer register,** **a staking reward has been implemented for all holders with locked TORN in the governance contract.**

[TORN](torn.md) holders can still lock their tokens into the governance contract as they used to for governance purposes. The significant difference is that they are now able to receive a portion of the fees collected by the protocol from relayers. Obviously, the proportion of the reward will be equal to the proportion of their locked TORN.

#### **FROM WHERE THESE COLLECTED FEES COME FROM ?**

The collection of these fees was made possible by the implementation of a decentralized relayer registry. In order to be listed on the protocol UI, relayers need to stake a given amount of TORN (currently set by governance at `300 TORN`) and keep enough TORN locked (\~`40 TORN` at the moment in April 2022) to be able to pay back the transaction fee to the staking contract. The functioning of this relayer registry is more extensively explained [on this forum post](https://torn.community/t/proposal-relayer-registry-setting-parameters-after-audit/2134) & on the [Relayer Registry documentation page](how-to-become-a-relayer.md).

In a nutshell, for each withdrawal through the relayer method, the chosen relayer has to pay a fee to the protocol from the staked balance (that should still be maintained above the `300 TORN` threshold). Currently, this fee has been fixed at `0.3%` by the governance and can be changed at any time through an on-chain proposal & vote.

### How to Stake TORN token ?

First, [connect your wallet to Tornado Cash](../tornado-cash-classic/how-to-connect-your-wallet.md).

As mentioned above, the process to lock TORN tokens has remained unchanged.

* The governance contract need to be approved in order to allow the transfer of your tokens to the smart contract. To do so, you need to click on the **`Approve`** button
* Once the approval is confirmed, you can chose the amount of token to lock, then click on **`Lock`**

## Alternative staking UI  

Since the deployment of [Altornado](https://altornado.com/#/stake) **TORN** holders have now an alternative open-source staking UI made by Tornado Cash Community, for the Tornado Cash community.

Yes, hence the name altornado: from ‚Äúalternative‚Äù and ‚Äútornado‚Äù üåù

Since the approval of [this](https://snapshot.org/#/torn-community.eth/proposal/0x331caa7b479669e8b836bd87ba9d91427c212ec29a2ede13d84c7190af18c931) snapshot proposal, they will be funded to deliver an amazing roadmap full of new features in the subsequent versions.

### Ok, this sounds awesome, but how do I stake ?!

* Let's start here ‚û°Ô∏è [https://altornado.com/#/stake](https://altornado.com/#/stake) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è, connect your wallet by clicking on **`Connect your wallet`**.
* You will need to approve the staking contract, so click on the **`Approve`** button.
