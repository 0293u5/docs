# How To Access The Tornado Cash In Goerli Network
Welcome everyone to the Tornado Cash testnet, and thank you for your interest in participating in the pilot phase of the application. The application is available for testing in the Goerli Network. In this article, we will explain to you in detail how you can test and use the Tornado Cash testnet platform in the Goerli network.
The prerequisite for testing the application is testnet is listed below. Please follow the below steps:


## Prerequisites for Goerli Test Network

- Test ETH that can be claimed from the Goerli faucet
- Test TORN, provided by the project team (not mandatory)
- Set your network in the Metamask wallet to **“Goerli Test Network”**

### Step 1: Receive test ETH token in your Wallet
Users can request the test ETH tokens from the Goerli network faucet.
Go to the **[Goerli faucet](https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/)**, enter your ethereum address, and just hit the Request button. You will receive your test ETH tokens shortly at your wallet address.

### Step 2: Get Test TORN Token
The TORN token is not mandatorily required to test the application and it's working. You can use Ethereum (ETH) and examine the Tornado Cash application in testnet.
However, if you want, you can request and get the test TORN token from the project team. Once received, open your Metamask wallet and check for the tokens.
If you are using this token for the first time, then the token will not be directly visible to you in the wallet, and you have to add it manually. You can add the token contract address manually by going to the **Custom Token** tab.
**TORN Contract Address - 0x77777feddddffc19ff86db637967013e6c6a116c**

We now have the test ETH and test TORN tokens in our Metamask wallet. We can proceed with testing and depositing tokens into the Tornado application.

### Step 3:  Select the network as Goerli Network 
As we have mentioned earlier that the Tornado Cash application is available in the Georli network, so set up your network connection to the Goerli network as shown in the above screenshot. [](https://)
